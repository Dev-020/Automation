## **Homebrew Compendium: The Gemini Protocol**

This document contains the custom subclass and Eldritch Invocation for the character Leo & Orion.

## **Sorcerous Origin: The Gemini Protocol**

*Your magic is not a gentle flowing tap; it is a pressurized reactor bonded to your soul. You have entered a permanent symbiosis with a sentient arcanatechnological entity. This construct has overwritten your natural magical pathways with its own volatile circuitry. You do not cast spells by gently shaping the Weave; you force raw arcane energy through the suit’s systems, generating immense heat and power. You are the pilot, the fuel, and the cooling system for a weapon that is constantly on the verge of a meltdown.*

### **Expanded Spell List**

The Gemini Protocol lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a spell. The following spells are added to the  spell list for you.

| Spell Level | Spells |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1st | Magic Missile, Shield |
| 2nd | Heat Metal, Mirror Image |
| 3rd | Fly, Haste |
| 4th | Fabricate, Dimension Door |
| 5th | Animate Objects, Wall of Force |

### **Protocol Integration (Level 3\)**

Your patron is the sentient A.I. of a powerful suit of armor you have bonded with. You gain the following features:

* **Symbiotic Armor:** You gain proficiency with **medium armor**, **smith's tools**, and **tinker’s tools**.  
* **Integrated Armory:** You gain proficiency with all **simple and martial weapons**.

#### **Equipment Manifest**

Your symbiotic link with Orion allows you to analyze, store, and replicate the forms of mundane equipment, as well as integrate unique magical items into your arsenal.

##### **Equipment Analysis**

You can spend 1 hour with a non-magical item, allowing Orion to perfectly analyze its structure and composition. The item can be any simple or martial weapon, a suit of armor, a shield, a tool, or any piece of adventuring gear. Once this analysis is complete, Orion permanently stores that item's blueprint in its Known Blueprints.

##### **Equipment Manifestation**

As a bonus action, you can have Orion manifest a perfect, non-magical copy of any item for which you have a blueprint in your current list of **Stored Blueprints**. This item appears in your empty hand or on the ground in your space. The manifested item has the following properties:

* The manifested item is sustained by your psychic link to Orion. It disappears if it is ever outside the range of your psychic tether for more than 1 minute, or if you manifest a different item. You can also dismiss the item at any time (no action required).  
* **Metaphysical Transience:** Manifested items are a temporary projection of matter sustained by the Infernal Core. They register as non-magical but have no monetary value and cannot be sold. They turn to harmless ash if a transaction involving them is completed.  
* **Replication Protocol:** You can manifest one item as part of this bonus action at no extra cost. You can choose to manifest additional, identical copies of that same item as part of the same bonus action, but you must gain **1 Core Strain** for each additional item you create.  
* If the manifested item is a weapon, it is considered your pact weapon and uses your Charisma modifier for its attack and damage rolls.  
* If the manifested weapon has the Ammunition property, it magically produces its own ammunition.

##### **Interaction with Magic Items**

You can use your analytical abilities to bond with and store existing magic items.

* You can perform the 1-hour analysis ritual on a magic item to bond with it. Orion integrates the specific item into its systems.  
* You can then dismiss the bonded magic item to an extradimensional space and summon it to your empty hand (or have it appear donned on your person, in the case of armor or clothing) as a bonus action.  
* **Crucially, Orion cannot create magical duplicates of this item; it can only store and summon the original.**  
* If a magic item requires attunement, the 1-hour bonding ritual also counts as the time required to attune to the item, using one of your available attunement slots.

#### **Arcane Infusion**

Your intimate knowledge of arcane-technology allows you to imbue items with minor and major magical properties. You gain the following two abilities:

##### **Minor Infusion**

As an action, you can touch one Tiny nonmagical object and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

* The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.  
* The object emits a recorded message, up to 6 seconds long, that can be replayed when tapped.  
* The object continuously emits a chosen odor or a nonverbal sound (like a bell tolling).  
* A static visual effect appears on the object's surface, such as a picture or up to 25 words of text.

The properties listed above are the most common applications of this feature, but you can create other minor, harmless sensory effects of a similar power level with the approval of your Dungeon Master. You can have a number of tinkered objects active at one time equal to your **Charisma** modifier.

##### **Major Infusion**

Instead of learning infusions automatically, you must decipher them from existing magic items to build a library of blueprints.

* **Learning Magical Blueprints:** To learn a new infusion, you must first have access to a magic item that possesses the property you wish to replicate. You can perform a special 1-hour ritual where you cast the *Identify* spell on the object. When you cast *Identify* as part of this ritual, you do not need to provide the 100 gp pearl component. Instead, you fuel the spell with your own volatile energy and gain **2 Core Strains**. Upon completion of the ritual, Orion successfully deciphers and stores the "magical blueprint," and it is added to your library of known blueprints.  
* **Infusing an Item:** You can infuse a non-magical item with a blueprint from your current list of **stored blueprints** by performing a 1-minute ritual. Alternatively, you can perform a **Rapid Infusion**:  
  * As an **action**, you can touch a non-magical item and choose a blueprint from your **stored blueprints**. You gain a number of **Core Strains** equal to the item's rarity (1 for Common, 2 for Uncommon, 3 for Rare, etc.), and the item is instantly infused.  
* You can have a number of items infused at one time equal to your **maximum Core Strain limit.** If you attempt to infuse an item beyond this limit, the oldest infusion immediately ends. The infused item is considered a magical item and functions as a magic item for any creature that uses it.

#### **Blueprint Library & Blueprints**

Your symbiotic link with Orion allows you to analyze and store the schematics for both mundane and magical items. This knowledge is organized into a two-tiered system.

* **Learning Schematics/Blueprints:**  
  * **Non-Magical:** You can spend 1 hour with a non-magical item (a weapon, suit of armor, shield, tool, or piece of adventuring gear) to permanently store its schematic.  
  * **Magical:** You can perform a 1-hour ritual using *Identify* (at the cost of **2 Core Strains**) to permanently learn the "magical blueprint" of a magic item's property.  
* **Known Blueprints:** The collection of all schematics and blueprints you have successfully learned is known as your library. This library is permanent, and there is no limit to the number of blueprints you can have in it.  
* **Stored Blueprints:** After you finish a long rest, you can choose a number of blueprints from your library to load into Orion's quick-access memory. The number of blueprints for both Magical and Non-Magical items that you can store is determined by your Proficiency Bonus. You can change your list of stored blueprints whenever you finish a long rest.

### **The Infernal Core (Level 3\)**

Your bond with the suit overwrites your natural magical physiology. You lose the **Spellcasting** and **Font of Magic** features normally granted by the Sorcerer class. Instead, you gain the **Infernal Core**, which dictates how you generate and control infernal energy.

* **Strain Limit:** Your safe operating limit is equal to your **Constitution Modifier \+ Proficiency Bonus**.

#### **Coolant Reserves**

Your raw magical potential is converted entirely into a volatile resource called **Sorcery Points (SP)**, which function as your system's **Coolant**.

* **Capacity:** Your maximum Sorcery Point pool is calculated by converting what would be your daily Spell Slots into points, and adding your Sorcerer Level to the total.  
  * *Conversion:* 1st=2, 2nd=3, 3rd=5, 4th=6, 5th=7, 6th=9, 7th=10, 8th=11, 9th=13.  
* **Restoration:** You regain all spent Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest. You cannot regain SP by any other means (no Flexible Casting).

#### **Volatile Accumulation**

If you push the engine beyond its limits, you risk a catastrophic meltdown.

* **Trigger:** If you end your turn with **Core Strain** greater than your **Strain Limit**, you trigger an **Overload**.  
  * You take **Force damage** equal to your **Current Strain**. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.  
* **Coolant Flush (Reaction):** When you would take damage from an Overload, you can spend **1 Sorcery Point** to reduce that specific instance of damage to **0**. This does not require an action and can only be performed when you take Overload damage.

#### **Overload Burst**

As a bonus action, you can release the volatile energy of your Infernal Core. This ability has two different effects depending on your current Core Strain level.

##### **Safety Vent (At Maximum Strain)**

* **Trigger:** You can use this ability when your Core Strain is **equal to** your maximum limit.  
* **Effect:** You release a controlled burst of energy in a **30-foot cone** originating from you. Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your  Spell Save DC. A creature takes **fire damage equal to 1d4 per point of Core Strain** on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.  
* **Consequence:** There is **no Volatile Backlash**. Your Core Strain immediately drops to 0\.

##### **True Overload (Above Maximum Strain)**

* **Trigger:** You can use this ability when your Core Strain is **at least 1 point above** your maximum limit.  
* **Effect:** You unleash an uncontrolled, devastating blast of energy in a **line 120 feet long and 5 feet wide** originating from you. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw against your  Spell Save DC. A creature takes **fire damage equal to 1d8 per point of Core Strain** on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.  
* **Consequence (Volatile Backlash):** After the blast, you must make a Constitution saving throw against your own  Spell Save DC.  
  * **On a success:** You take **half** of the total damage dealt by the burst.  
  * **On a failure:** You take the **full** damage dealt by the burst.  
  * If this ability was used after being primed by your `Indomitable` feature, you automatically fail this saving throw.  
* **Your Core Strain immediately drops to 0 after using this ability.**

##### **Maximum Overload (Unstable Overload State)**

* If you use your **True Overload** feature while in an **Unstable Overload** state, you unleash the full, unfiltered energy of the critical overload. The damage type becomes Force and it ignores resistances. Damage calculation for the blast is calculated in two parts which are added together:  
1. **Blast Damage:** You roll **1d8** for each point of your current total Core Strain.  
2. **Withheld Damage:** You add the damage that was withheld from the **Indomitable** surge. This is **1d10** for each point of Core Strain you gained when the **Indomitable** feature was triggered.  
* **Core Meltdown:** The 120-foot line of the blast tears a scar in reality, creating a permanent zone of volatile energy. This area is now a **10-foot wide, 120-foot long** zone with the following properties:  
  * The area is **difficult terrain**.  
  * A creature takes **2d6 Force damage** when it **enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there**.  
  * Any creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw** against your  Spell Save DC or become **frightened** until the end of its next turn.

#### **Adaptive Spell Protocol**

* Your mastery over Orion’s systems allows you to maintain a single, reconfigurable spell schematic. You designate one of your  "spells known" as your **Adaptive Spell**.  
* As an **Action**, you can **spend a number of Core Strains equal to the new spell's level** (minimum of 1, maximum of 3\) to temporarily reconfigure the module. Choose another spell from the  **spell list**, which must be of a level for which you have Pact Magic spell slots. Your Adaptive Spell is then replaced with the chosen spell.  
* The reconfigured module is unstable. The first time you cast the new spell, it is cast as normal. **Immediately after the spell is cast, the module reverts, and your Adaptive Spell returns to the original spell you chose.**

#### **Guardian Protocol**

* When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to have the suit intercept. You gain **1 Core Strain**, and your Armor Class increases by an amount equal to your Constitution modifier against the triggering attack, potentially causing it to miss.  
* If the attack still hits, you can gain **another Core Strain** (2 Core Strains Total) to **reduce the damage you take from that attack by an amount equal to your  level \+ your Charisma modifier**.

#### **Core Casting Protocol**

* You can channel the raw energy of the Infernal Core to cast spells you know without expending a spell slot. When you cast a spell, you can choose to use this feature.  
* To cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you do not expend a slot. Instead, you generate **Core Strain**:  
  * **Cost:** You gain **Core Strain** equal to the **Level of the spell** you cast.  
* **Metamagic:** If you apply Metamagic, you gain additional **Core Strain** equal to the **Sorcery Point cost** of that Metamagic.

#### **Indomitable**

* **Indomitable:** If damage reduces you to 0 hit points but does not kill you outright, you instead drop to **1 hit point**. If you are in `Autonomous Mode` when this feature activates, you **immediately enter `Integrated Mode`**.  
* Immediately upon activation, Orion's core goes critical and you **double the current number of core strains you have**. The overload damage you would normally take from this surge is **withheld and contained** by the suit's emergency systems, placing you in an **Unstable Overload** state.  
  * If the **current number** of core strains after this ability triggers is **below** your core strain limit, **then you would not go into Unstable Overload state.**  
  * **This state ends if your Core Strain drops below or equal to your maximum limit for any reason.**  
* Once this protocol activates, it cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

### **Pact of the Chassis (Level 3\)**

This feature replaces the standard Pact Boon options and reflects the symbiotic nature of Leo and Orion.

#### **Weapon Manifestation:**

* As a bonus action, you can have Orion manifest a perfect copy of any weapon for which it has a stored schematic. This manifested weapon appears in your hand, is your pact weapon, and uses your Charisma modifier for its attack and damage rolls. It disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or if you manifest a different weapon.

#### **Autonomous Mode:**

* As a bonus action, you can separate from your suit. At the start of each of your turns while in this mode, you take **1d4 psychic damage** as your consciousness strains to maintain the tether.  
* While in Autonomous Mode, you are two separate bodies on the battlefield, but you remain mentally linked. The following rules apply:

##### **Shared Being:**

* The streamlined Orion Chassis is considered an **object**, not a creature. It has an Armor Class equal to your own. Any damage the chassis takes is taken by you from your own hit point pool. If the chassis is forced to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonuses.   
  * **Tether Fail-Safe**: If the Orion chassis is ever more than 60 feet away from you at any point in time, the tether's fail-safe protocol is automatically triggered. The suit is instantly recalled to your space, and you immediately enter Integrated Mode. This also happens when Leo is incapacitated. 

##### **Remote Action:**

* You can act from either your own position or the chassis's position on the battlefield. When you take the Attack action or cast a spell, you can determine if it originates from your space or the chassis's space. You can also command the chassis to move up to 30 feet (no cost).  
* To compensate for this risk, your abilities in this mode are enhanced:

##### **Coordinated Casting**: 

While in Autonomous Mode, you can leverage Orion's independent processing to double your magical output.

* **The Command:** As a **Bonus Action**, you can command Orion to cast a spell you know.  
* **The Cost:** You generate **Core Strain** equal to the **level at which the spell is cast**.  
* **Outside of combat**, you can use Autonomous Mode freely for exploration, utility, and roleplaying as if Orion is a separate creature.

#### **Integrated Mode:**

* As a bonus action, you can integrate with your suit. While integrated, you gain the following benefits:  
* **Enhanced AC:** Your Armor Class is calculated as your original Armor Class \+ your Constitution modifier \+ your Charisma modifier.  
* **Weapon Manifestation:** You can use your bonus action to manifest your pact weapon.

##### **System Override:** 

* When you cast a  spell using your action, you can choose to do one of the following:  
  * **Offensive Override (Cost: 1 Core Strain):** Choose a damage type to which the primary target of your spell has **resistance**. Until the start of your next turn, the target loses that resistance. If the target has immunity to the chosen damage type, it is instead treated as having resistance to it for the duration.  
  * **Defensive Override (Cost: 1 Core Strain):** You channel the spell's residual energy into a specialized defensive field. **Choose one damage type** (such as slashing, fire, or poison). You gain **resistance to that damage type until the end of your next turn**.

### **Optimized System (Level 6\)**

*Your constant use of the suit has optimized its core functions, making both of your operational modes more efficient. You gain the following benefits:*

#### **While in Autonomous Mode,**

* the psychic damage you take from the Psychic Tether at the start of your turn is reduced by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.

##### **Remote Dexterity:** 

* The maximum range of your psychic tether increases to 120 feet, and the chassis can use any of your tool proficiencies remotely.

##### **Targeting Matrix:** 

* Your psychic link to the chassis acts as a perfect targeting solution. While in Autonomous Mode, you **double the range** of any spell that originates from the chassis's space or you, and your  spells **ignore half cover and three-quarters cover**.

#### **While in Integrated Mode,** 

* you can choose to activate your suit's “Domain Protocol” at the start of your turn (no action required). While this protocol is active, you gain **1 Core Strain** at the start of each of your turns, but you gain the following two benefits:

##### **Singularity Field:** 

* You project a field of localized gravitational distortion. Your movement speed cannot be reduced, and the area within a **10-foot radius** of you is **difficult terrain for your enemies**. When a hostile creature is moved out of the field (willingly or forced), it must succeed on a **Strength saving throw** against your  Spell Save DC or its **speed becomes 0** until the end of the turn. A creature can only be affected by this saving throw once per turn.

##### **Threat Matrix:** 

* At the start of each of your turns, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to **(your proficiency bonus × the number of hostile creatures in your Stabilizer Field) \+ your  Level**.

### **Binary Partition (Level 10\)**

Your neural architecture has evolved to support multi-threaded arcane processing. You can fracture the Gemini Protocol's consciousness to maximize output, either by splitting your physical form or by overclocking your single frame.

**1\. Parallel Processing (The Action)**

When you use your Action to cast a spell, you can cast a second spell as part of the same Action.

* **Cost:** You generate full **Core Strain** for both spells. If the second spell is a cantrip, you generate **one core strain** instead.

**2\. Mode Protocols**

The physical manifestation of this processing depends on your current state:

* **Protocol A: Autonomous Mode (The Fractal)**  
  * **Effect:** Orion separates into **two identical constructs** (Alpha and Beta).  
  * **Benefit:** You have three distinct points of origin for your spells (Leo, Alpha, Beta).  
  * **The Price:** You share a single hit point pool across three bodies.  
* **Protocol B: Integrated Mode (The Juggernaut)**  
  * **Effect:** The two AIs fuse within your single frame—one focusing on casting, the other on stabilizing the reactor.  
  * **Benefit:** When you use Parallel Processing in this mode, you gain **Resistance to all damage** until the start of your next turn.  
  * **The Synergy:** This Resistance applies to the self-inflicted **Overload damage** you might take from casting the two spells. This makes Integrated Mode the "Safe" way to go Nova, allowing you to tank your own heat.
